## Task 1: 'time' library

# **Task 1a**:
# Import the 'time' library and make use of the 'time.sleep()'
# function to create a 10 seconds countdown timer that counts
# to 1, printing the number of seconds remaining every second.




# **Task 1b**:
# Modify your code from Task 1a to include an 'input()' function
# asking the user for the number to countdown from, before
# counting down every second from the number given by the user.
