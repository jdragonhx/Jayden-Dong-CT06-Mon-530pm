## Recap 1: Debugging Average Score Program

### There is a total of 3 bugs in the following program.
### Identify and fix the bugs:

# score_one = 80
# score_two = 90
# score_three = 75

# total = score_one + score_two + score_three

# average_score = total / 3

# student_name = "Alex"

# print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + str(average_score))



## Task 1: For Loop: 1 to 10 using range(start, stop)

# Use a 'for' loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
# for i in range (1, 10):
#     print(i)

## Task 2: Even Numbers 2-20 Loop using
##         range(start, stop, step)

# Print all even numbers between 2 and 20 using a 'for' loop and
# range().

# for i in range (2, 22, 2):
#     print(i)

## Task 3: Countdown From 10 For Loop

# Use a 'for' loop and range() to count down from 10 to 1.

for i in range (10, 1, -1):
    print
