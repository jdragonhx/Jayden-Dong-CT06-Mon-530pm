# Task 1: Positive or Negative Numbers
# Write a program that will let the user know if the number they
# have entered is positive or negative.

# 1. Ask the user to input a number
# 2. Using an 'if' statement, check if the number is greater than 0
#         If it is, print "{number} is positive."
# 3. Use an 'else' statement for when the number is not greater than 0.
#         In this case, print "{number} is negative."

# number = int(input("give me a number: "))
# if number > -1:
#     print(  str(number) + " is a positive number")
# else:
#     print(  str(number) + " is a negative number")
